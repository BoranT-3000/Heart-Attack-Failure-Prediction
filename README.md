# Heart-Attack-Failure-Prediction


This repository contains machine learning models and analyses for predicting heart attack and heart failure risks using the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction and Heart Failure Prediction datasets. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy in predicting cardiovascular risks. Various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been explored.
